Arcanine
--------

- Arcanine is an IRC bot written in Ruby using the awesome on_irc library!

- Arcanine aims to be pluggable, but is a longs way from it! :[

- Arcanine is full of messy code and bugs, some features are even broken, some features call programs that might not even be installed on certain systems.

- Arcanine is named after a pokemon!

- Arcanine is a work in progress.
