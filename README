Arcanine is an IRC bot written in Ruby using the awesome on_irc library!

Installation:

  You will need git, ruby, and ruby gems. On Ubuntu you can install them all with:

    $ sudo apt-get install git ruby rubygems

  Now make a clone of the Arcanine repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:wmeister86/Arcanine.git

  Install the on_irc gem:

    $ gem install on_irc

  Note: Some commands such as toilet and asciifart will not work unless you have te appropriate programs installed (toilet/fortune), and the correct data files inside the "data" directory. Fixing this shouldnt be any problem with a little knowledge of linux/ruby.

Configuring the bot:

  The configuration for the bot is in YAML. Look at the "example.config.yaml" and modify as needed. When your done rename it to "config.yaml".

Running the bot:

  $ ruby run.rb

Adding new commands (aka "Triggers"):

  Create a new file in arcanine/trigger, subclass Arcanine::Trigger. Define a regex and action method. Triggers can be reloaded while the bot is running using the reload trigger. Be sure to look at the other triggers for examples.
